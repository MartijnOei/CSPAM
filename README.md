# CSPAM
CSPAM, short for CASA SPAM, is a pipeline for reducing low-frequency radio astronomy data


Obtaining accurate images of the sky with low-frequency, interferometric radio data can be a difficult and slow process. CSPAM is a code that combines the powers of Python, CASA and SPAM to offer an advanced though easy-to-use pipeline for low-frequency radio data calibration.

CSPAM has been developed initially by Kasper van Dam M.Sc. (GitHub: kvandam). The software builds on the NRAO's CASA (Common Astronomy Software Applications), and SPAM (Source Peeling and Atmospheric Modeling), an algorithm conceived by Huib Intema Ph.D. for correcting ionospheric distortions.

Martijn Oei B.Sc. (GitHub: MartijnOei) is currently continuing the CSPAM development, alongside Huib Intema Ph.D. and Francesco de Gasperin Ph.D. at Leiden Observatory, Leiden University, The Netherlands.
